## About

I believe cities move better when their data does too. I spend my days wrangling maps and my evenings chasing transit feeds, writing the pipelines, parsers, and dashboards that turn raw GTFS into something a city can act on.

Professionally, I keep a large ArcGIS Enterprise ecosystem humming: automating the quiet, unglamorous work of account lifecycle management, license reclamation, and organizational reporting so that the people who make maps can focus on making maps.

In my own time, I volunteer with [TransitMatters](https://github.com/transitmatters) to help hold the MBTA accountable through data. There's something deeply satisfying about a slow-zone alert that actually reflects a slow zone, or a ferry tab that didn't exist last month. Small things that riders notice even if they never see the code behind them.
