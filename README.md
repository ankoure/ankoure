> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hey, I'm **Andrew**!
>
> I am a map enthusiast by day and a transportation advocate by night. I often write code to help automate the administration of ArcGIS Enterprise and Online for a large organization. This has ranged from automating the process of removing accounts from departed employees, to re-claiming licenses from inactive users, to generating reports. 
> 
> I'm currently volunteering with [TransitMatters](https://github.com/transitmatters) to help with their mission of providing data-driven advocacy to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Agency (MBTA). So far I have added support for the [Mattpan Line]([https://traintracker.transitmatters.org/](https://traintracker.transitmatters.org/?line=Mattapan&category=old_vehicles)) to the New Train Tracker. Added a number of bus routes to their [Data Dashboard](https://dashboard.transitmatters.org/) and am working on adding support for Ferry data.
